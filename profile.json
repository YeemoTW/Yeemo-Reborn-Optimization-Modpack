That Chunk","description":"Delays client chunk unloading","body":"This Fabric loader mod prevents the Minecraft client from immediately unloading chunks when it receives chunk unload packets from the server. Instead, client chunks get periodically cleaned up based on distance away from the player.\n\nThis chunk unloading strategy is particularly useful for participating in ice boat racing or elytra course racing on highly active multiplayer servers where servers may struggle to keep up with sending chunk updates to all of the players. Typically, without this mod, a player would start to move into empty chunks when several players on the server are simultaneously traveling at high velocities. The issue is resolved since the cached chunks can be readily redrawn before the fresh chunk data comes in over the network.\n\nYou may also increase your view distance by setting the Ignore Server Render Distance option in this mod's config.\n","published":"2022-08-07T07:50:23.983661Z","updated":"2023-10-25T07:33:56.706909Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":353996,"followers":282,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["kJiGSIS3","hImvzVsy","gXYDi7ze","vzE9EKT2","PvLL6TzN","jmtkq16F","WkqtulFh","TbJQtyy8","U7TGvlSX","8QSY2PFn"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LXJlc5WJ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"TbJQtyy8","project_id":"LXJlc5WJ","author_id":"PgQl7zd4","featured":false,"name":"Hold That Chunk 2.0.1","version_number":"2.0.1","changelog":"- Fix a rare null pointer exception that throws when `world` is null during a chunk load","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-11-06T14:27:44.669940Z","downloads":332680,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"2052b50afc2643fc39d12ba1e6aa2f275c925f71c7e3bf327a9b2af7144617365d7760c34c58af3edd59e7c091e8a36df788e8d84e41b08cbb6fe7bdcb559c40","sha1":"b045e7ac468a78922515c180d4403f8380ec9fec"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LXJlc5WJ/versions/TbJQtyy8/holdthatchunk-2.0.1%2B1.19.jar","filename":"holdthatchunk-2.0.1+1.19.jar","primary":true,"size":26471,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"5U5Y73uW","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"CtMNOUcV","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"EXrxCjl6","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"9ACWUOXp","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"8wCjeiSb","user":{"id":"PgQl7zd4","username":"dlee13","name":"The_TermiGator","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4022777?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-03-15T06:45:53.000344Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"holdthatchunk-2.0.11.19.jar"},"mods\\moreculling-1.20.4-0.22.1.jar":{"sha512":"c562f4319c6aa13b84bb92ee63074792648af2a3d8711a2b49e865e25b2690cd26ad7b272d59dc228bb39315c035a32792755fb896d3d939ef23533fb80cbde5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"51shyZVL","slug":"moreculling","project_type":"mod","team":"lt2h1d9p","title":"More Culling","description":"A mod that changes how multiple types of culling are handled in order to improve performance","body":"# More Culling  \n### A mod that changes how multiple types of culling are handled in order to improve performance\nCulling is when you don't render things that the player can't see, to improve performance\n\nRequires Cloth Config!\n  \n**Make sure to report any bugs [here](https://github.com/fxmorin/moreculling/issues)!** \n\n**Discord Server:** [https://discord.gg/SGFDrvA](https://discord.gg/SGFDrvA)  \n  \n**Head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/fxmorin/MoreCulling/wiki) for information on:**   \nWhat's Culled, Performance, Compatibility, Bug Fixes, and more!  \n\nCheck out [MoreCullingExtra](https://modrinth.com/mod/morecullingextra) for extra culling features  \n\n## My other optimizations/fixes\n* [MemoryLeakFix](https://modrinth.com/mod/memoryleakfix) -

Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2023-12-20T22:19:09.571967Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":3294451,"followers":8076,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ZSNsJrPI","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium 0.11.2","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.11.2","changelog":"Lithium 0.11.2 for Minecraft 1.20.1 is the same as the previous release, just for 1.20.1 instead of 1.20.\n\nYou can check out all configuration options [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/blob/mc1.20.1-0.11.2/lithium-mixin-config.md).\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-12T23:58:59.682048Z","downloads":1194253,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d1b5c90ba8b4879814df7fbf6e67412febbb2870e8131858c211130e9b5546e86b213b768b912fc7a2efa37831ad91caf28d6d71ba972274618ffd59937e5d0d","sha1":"8f4642147e60827f728badac7a819d1a9f3b25d5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/versions/ZSNsJrPI/lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","filename":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","primary":true,"size":645865,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"uhPSqlnd","username":"2No2Name","name":"2No2Name","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50278648?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-31T09:13:58.517719Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"TEZXhE2U","username":"jellysquid3","name":"JellySquid","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1363084?v=4","bio":"Professional idiot at day, maniac programmer by night.","created":"2021-01-03T00:49:18.373336Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar"},"mods\\itemswapper-fabric-0.5.3-mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"297df7907b96bb545f3965d00ad87c98f0e3d04a93f625002db37287f49af785f5a02ef1e5c47c8e15022f9ed4bd980ff2d5fa9158aff0868928c81d10cd9149","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"RPOSBQgq","slug":"itemswapper","project_type":"mod","team":"b225Efzu","title":"ItemSwapper","description":"Inventory update concept for hotswapping items.","body":"# ItemSwapper\n\n> This mod is still in development and may change over time.

In the item wheel, pressing the middle mouse button while having an item selected switches to related items(if available).\n\n## Features\n\n- Switch between items from the inventory\n- Show the inventory from an empty hand\n- Switch between items from shulker boxes in the inventory(requires the mod/plugin on the server)\n- Item wheel for block pallets\n- Item list for dynamic items like tools, food, potions, etc.\n- Fully customizable via resource packs\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- FabricAPI\n\n## Credits\n\n- [Xisumavoid](https://www.youtube.com/xisumavoid) for the idea/video of the concept\n- [LizardOfOz](https://www.youtube.com/LizardOfOz) Designer\n- [Stridey](https://modrinth.com/user/Stridey) Textures\n- [DnatorGames](https://twitter.com/DnatorGames) Logo\n- [Ratty](https://github.com/RodentMastermind) for the help with the resource pack\n\n## Images\n\n![Plank Types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/1.19/img/planktypes.png)\n![Wood Options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/1.19/img/woodoptions.png)\n![Dyes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/1.19/img/dyes.png)\n![Tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/1.19/img/tools.png)\n![Potions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/1.19/img/potions.png)\n![Redstone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/1.19/img/redstone.png)","published":"2022-10-13T20:10:52.227649Z","updated":"2024-01-15T18:25:11.345549Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":179337,"followers":924,"categories":["game-mechanics","management","storage"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","23w43a","23w43b","23w44a","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["bukkit","fabric","paper","purpur","spigot"],"versions":["X24q2iia","O2KOHSPJ","Ri0QCixj","j5VqRZlF","QmIKzS7b","rf2jLZvC","ydbCLkJa","6cmQDpI7","YAMyEX1t","MZAKaMqE","WZU4j0Uk","OgfOEQMc","sFclEion","5SS5s8Mr","c02hnEPx","ezuMmkdM","NEBVxulw","E7jCNr0p","Z2YZdulh","zUblkil8","eBv5OCE8","IIT4cam4","UAt5HtUi"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/RPOSBQgq/2ab4614cc4288baa911be0365cd22203e75b9233.png"},"version":{"id":"NEBVxulw","project_id":"RPOSBQgq","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":false,"name":"v0.5.3-1.20 - Fabric","version_number":"v0.5.3-1.20","changelog":"## What's Changed\r\n* Fixed that the mod could put Shulkers into Shulkers #172\r\n* Added copper ore to the built-in palettes\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/ItemSwapper/compare/v0.5.2-1.20...v0.5.3-1.20","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-17T21:12:37.809247Z","downloads":65050,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ca3d145c48936b3eab92f5ab9bf64befe5ed15ec","sha512":"297df7907b96bb545f3965d00ad87c98f0e3d04a93f625002db37287f49af785f5a02ef1e5c47c8e15022f9ed4bd980ff2d5fa9158aff0868928c81d10cd9149"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/RPOSBQgq/versions/NEBVxulw/itemswapper-fabric-0.5.3-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"itemswapper-fabric-0.5.3-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":794256,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"b225Efzu","user":{"id":"31j7L936","username":"Stridey","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/31j7L936/02b2f8231578d72f1c9b404edb848928a6402073.png","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-01T15:49:45.517346Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Textures","ordering":0},{"team_id":"b225Efzu","user":{"id":"Qnt13hO8","username":"tr7zw","name":"tr7zw","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Qnt13hO8/icon.png","bio":"https://tr7zw.dev/","created":"2022-05-04T13:41:52.033912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"itemswapper-fabric-0.5.3-mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\Bookshelf-Fabric-1.20.1-20.1.8.jar":{"sha512":"3cb7c6dae463d5c60f321f187039832c504c6d76963b463ce26897c450b8b2da70addf21df5bd30725908ba1835eaf891b1eb193be6b77219142093950223605","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"uy4Cnpcm","slug":"bookshelf-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"qdYl5sw1","title":"Bookshelf","description":"An open source library for other mods!","body":"<p>Bookshelf is a collection of code, frameworks, utilities, and other resources. Many mods utilize Bookshelf's code base to power their own mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Why use a library mod?</h3>\n<p>Library mods such as Bookshelf allow seemingly unrelated mods to share parts of the same code base. This reduces the amount of time and effort required to develop certain mods and features. The Library's code base is also tested in a wider range of circumstances and communities which can lead to less bugs and better performance in mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Features for Players</h3>\n<p>While this mod is primarily for mod authors, there are a few useful features for Players.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands</a> like /bookshelf hand to get item IDs.</li>\n<li>Many new <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs\" rel=\"nofollow\">datapack features</a> like crafting recipes that damage items with durability rather than consuming them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Features for Modders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/blob/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/serialization/Serializers.java\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serialization for JSON/Network/NBT formats.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/util\" rel=\"nofollow\">Utility Functions.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/registry\" rel=\"nofollow\">Registry manager, including non-forge registry types, debugging, and statistics.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#recipe-types\" rel=\"nofollow\">New recipe types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#ingredients\" rel=\"nofollow\">New ingredient types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#loot-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot condition types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#global-loot-modifiers\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot modifier types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#item-predicates\" rel=\"nofollow\">New item predicates.</a></li>\n<li>Check <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiki</a> for more!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style.

In ModMenu these are accordingly labelled.\n\n### How does this mod work?\n\n**At it's core, this mod is quite simple:**\n\nNormally, when quitting a singleplayer world, the client will wait until the server thread has finished saving the world before going to the Title Screen.\nThis mod skips this waiting period and lets the server continue saving in the background.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** this does not always make quitting a world instant, as the client can still take a bit of time to unload rendered chunks etc. However, even in that case you will see a speedup as clientside unloading and serverside saving now perform simultaneously instead of one after the other.\n\n**Of course in practice this is not quite that easy:**\n\nWhen working with multiple threads like this, many problems arise.\nFor example, when going to the world list, Minecraft will try to read its level data but fails because the background saving still locks the world file.\n\nInstead, we now access the information through the still saving server.\nSimilarly, when trying to edit, delete or recreate the world, we have to use the existing session.\n\nTo keep these processes thread safe, a lot of synchronization has to be done to ensure the saving server and the client don't get in each other's way.\n\nFor some things, like rejoining the still saving world or making a backup, we just wait for the server to finish saving completely.\nWe also wait for the worlds to finish saving when quitting the game to ensure no data is lost.\n\n### Thanks to...\n\n#### Translators:\n- Felix14-v2 (Russian)\n- Cccc-owo (Simplified Chinese)\n- JustAlittleWolf (German)\n- YakisikliBaran (Turkish)\n- Skidamek (Polish)\n- Oondanomala (Italian)\n- Madis0 (Estonian)\n- notlin4 (Traditional Chinese)\n- BurrConnie (Ukrainian)\n- GodGun968 (Simplified Chinese)\n- ImVietnam (Vietnamese)\n- ishi-sama (French)\n- KAGUYA-1137 (Japanese)\n####\n\n### Compatibility\n\nWith the help of [MixinExtras](https://github.com/LlamaLad7/MixinExtras) and a custom Mixin Config Plugin, the mixins have been designed to be very non-intrusive while also being very effective.\n\nBecause of that there is currently no known incompatibilities.\n\nIf you do suspect an incompatibility with another mod, please [open an issue](#problems)!\n\n### Problems?\n\nIf you are experiencing any problems, please open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/KingContaria/FastQuit/issues)!\n\nMake sure to attach important info like other mods you were using, log- or crash-files and if possible steps to reproduce.\n\nBefore uploading any files make sure to get rid of personal data!

features (context-dependent style) unreliable.\n\nIf you play with content mods, I recommend also installing [Dynamic Crosshair Compat](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamiccrosshaircompat).\n\nIf you like dynamic UI elements, also check out my other mod [Auto HUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/autohud) that extends dynamic behaviour to most of the HUD.\n\nDynamicCrosshair is currently not compatible with [Exordium](https://modrinth.com/mod/exordium) (set its `enabledGui` setting to false to use its other features).","published":"2022-05-15T15:58:15.616504Z","updated":"2024-01-12T17:53:15.494177Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":550972,"followers":684,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["20bC160n","zJdREVIO","IXij3556","GkGeCML8","Jx2bA8fW","wX0EkxBG","UIPy4N6Y","u6oZjWMI","fwgB6xzq","rbuG9j4d","42x8E1l2","I3ozSAMN","UsI5wvVJ","Ex7R0pvH","bevKbyCT","C9PPMB8n","PUz7ZA69","DnIkKSEu","pKw86PFV","L1X78OCz","piwY5EqP","KdZ4nnQf","KCnkG2JM","vOx5xdxw","8cW3fCjp","OojuYcAm","SoTS6lF5","JZoNSBuy","N8iKshJP","vOMoMaOE","dSEqWeht","6x22u0T1","N3ze65Pu","8npnkOAY","JCXboA43","GwfJ6OPL","Q5W9seuT","MDMciNGY","DOxF1Usr","kVzqYdl5","hBz2RX9S","mqjafYwh","4XF7aDYQ","PDcGuAk3","dB2WXccw","oE6ADLJm","kBkiCSXP","KdRiHgim","Ngbs1lmT","p8mFGtnA","aT7BTmm2","7pIz7Bqe","5Rbzl2ai","HQNnNcTz","rzl6699L","b1MI0lNn","XXp55Fwj","aDXQGAnW","7LySfCZd","jwMWMQBh","3Rj2xiej","UrGLoyuO","jdd7O6I5","3BXMBlz0","Bgo2WQoz","4yNSnLVO","1HKz8pDD","cdWvTN6A","zma0Z88N","EJvo2aYT","SnHjacoX","L3cqS0s1","XxwoXEjt","uuUU7D4O","oGBybcWG","ha2GrJES","qSS7rxZG","kEvLJuWh","nhu2REPZ","AVTfWKih","kgZyjYD0","25UaxOtl","Q7LLoEz8","m758kre1","VlilX4g3","NpJSZyut","KLOwuZTc","siGvzEkG","pnStFlrz","zT12VILM","cR2jSKNv","S5sH62fG","UwrH9Wmp","PYMFga4Y","5ABRCqrl","svCwRMnR","wlHubjbx","me9sUGWp","GaDrUzLS","H2k9LvrK","B8uyNMAs","dHnDtwk3","AF6KCHFM","hW7fVOwD","xMsvqe7U","rOBAdNim","kV3gDaO6","Afi523uo","n7vNnWWX","hUj6v5bw","4ZNImu1V","7POTmnEb","HEyECMZD","BfvDyEpZ","B3fvmlGz","N4UrisV7","d5kHzOKy","ONH6Kqie","YZEVRL4i","J6uJYksd","h3YFJv7Z","ggoGe2EL","d1DZkc4J","1A4txeh8","lJhn7D9r","PlUmODOj","OvVeBAYa","RqouYFCA","yl7hdLYl","SgFUFMUD","iKnz6GmD","8x7iVA0A","DLtLuMzW","Vk1E4s8i","P70fS7oo","I1X42LQO","GxY44U4X","vW2z45Qw","gTjxflCI","8TADH0x4","nqnapHoW","4Oy7MCbK","j6JI3Ye5","AKd5ifeI","yI2M7Yw8","plDJhPkU","TBUQvVSc","wrKCukUs","ob3ideD4","1Cz6IyIk","z2n9Rh5O","83ZByaiI","vNnu7BoP","9TBX0qkD","U4QPyiFl","MneD8ExX","rp8sdu78","eCPSnqOy","eRIHItNH","6W6aaYaB","qumfSFz3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZcR9weSm/8da8af58ca961f937bd05d41dcefa26be7b5c182.png"},"version":{"id":"9TBX0qkD","project_id":"ZcR9weSm","author_id":"bQuYYbeE","featured":false,"name":"[Fabric

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

Attempting to set the fog distance to extensive ranges triggers a bug in Sodium, leading to significant performance drops, especially above the world height. \r\n\r\n**It is important for users to read this information and refrain from immediately attributing any fog disable issues to us, which might lead to unnecessary reports on our issue tracker.**\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/FlashyReese/sodium-extra-fabric/compare/mc1.20.1-0.5.0...mc1.20.1-0.5.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-14T08:47:52.386754Z","downloads":619298,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"f22f22df15c494a428a8113739267ded3a7e2732158a8e948c115e278d9ffcfb9a94faa7ba3a37364318c895d9d43271ecc58a483b8e49e030394c60a5325c25","sha1":"74b6dce1ede645ffdecf1185fa05701cef68840d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PtjYWJkn/versions/80a0J5Cn/sodium-extra-0.5.1%2Bmc1.20.1-build.112.jar","filename":"sodium-extra-0.5.1+mc1.20.1-build.112.jar","primary":true,"size":365533,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"15a94f7d8e5407381ba9bcff6a41e954ab23c902460483a35ffa93fa1c05e464c0994049165c42f73a07a15b36cb84099542c18d0edc7b4d596ac5d0941487ad","sha1":"bc9a206b4a38056c0b16c5a653021b7690285c53"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PtjYWJkn/versions/80a0J5Cn/sodium-extra-0.5.1%2Bmc1.20.1-build.112-sources.jar","filename":"sodium-extra-0.5.1+mc1.20.1-build.112-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":256858,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Bh37bMuy","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"YL57xq9U","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"EfhDgRdO","user":{"id":"QXAY01zS","username":"FlashyReese","name":"FlashyReese","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30311066?v=4","bio":"Studying Software Engineer at UADY","created":"2020-10-23T09:28:46.803957Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"I7ggF6B5","project_id":"PtjYWJkn","author_id":"QXAY01zS","featured":true,"name":"Sodium Extra 0.5.4 for Minecraft 1.20.1","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.5.4","changelog":"## What's Changed\n* Update for Sodium 0.5.6\n* Small fix by @notlin4 in https://github.com/FlashyReese/sodium-extra-fabric/pull/372\n* Resolve node.js actions deprecation, Avoid chmod by @Kichura in https://github.com/FlashyReese/sodium-extra-fabric/pull/375\n\n## New Contributors\n* @notlin4 made their first contribution in https://github.com/FlashyReese/sodium-extra-fabric/pull/372\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/FlashyReese/sodium-extra-fabric/compare/mc1.20.2-0.5.3...mc1.20.1-0.5.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-28T00:17:09.120118Z","downloads":9410,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"ab561186421776d0db506dcbf1a724f80b345be5769ff00aa4327161c79af6e3f353eb65345ce06da30546ffa6b43e1c4a4c41dd246b7e473b131fd727997a85","sha1":"890864a6ab5d77d57d8d757bcc31f5379b5a11b1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PtjYWJkn/versions/I7ggF6B5/sodium-extra-0.5.4%2Bmc1.20.1-build.115.jar","filename":"sodium-extra-0.5.4+mc1.20.1-build.115.jar","primary":true,"size":385539,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"1cb2f87edbf21b50ce547a51fc7b6ce85790cc6e","sha512":"0199b81108bd08ace74d2f7eecf67c3fbefd85a665ea77f168502ee548966a7e402b65b7e425f1588f5a9273123dbcecb153af6afefc893631d5bb32f44e01dd"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/PtjYWJkn/versions/I7ggF6B5/sodium-extra-0.5.4%2Bmc1.20.1-build.115-sources.jar","filename":"sodium-extra-0.5.4+mc1.20.1-build.115-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":279813,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Bh37bMuy","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"rUXIwGKA","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"YL57xq9U","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"sodium-extra-0.5.1+mc1.20.1-build.112.jar"},"mods\\fabric-api-0.91.0+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"cc8d87b50e1db9df4715f4194e85f3f80f0c816d1636f19d9a31fd4608203c588720318d9659f066a5ebc1ae5f9a2dc7a5f37bb78fef28fc51b9765a42f91147","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"P7dR8mSH","slug":"fabric-api","project_type":"mod","team":"BZoBsPo6","title":"Fabric API","description":"Lightweight and modular API providing common hooks and intercompatibility measures utilized by mods using the Fabric toolchain.","body":"# Fabric API\n\nEssential hooks for modding with Fabric.\n\nFabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first.

I went from changing shader settings to adding shader settings. Eventually i decided i wanted to try and bring out my own visual taste in the shader. So here i am, with a pretty sizeable edit of chocapic13's shaders.\n\n# Requirements\n- AMD graphics card\n- Nvidia graphics card\n- Apple Devices or Intel Integrated Graphics are low priority.

This will explain the absence of updates. Why again? It's just not fun anymore and I am always worried about once again being embedded in annoying discord drama that somehow manages to suck every bit of enjoyment out of modding. There hasn't been anyone willing to step up and take over development and that's partly my fault. This notice is months late. If you enjoy fastload and intend to maintain it, just contact me on discord for a discussion. Please keep in mind that I won't respond quickly because I don't really use discord much at all anymore. Thank you for taking your time to read this!\n\n# Short explanation\nFastload is a *relatively* simple mod that changes some crucial parts of world loading to speed it up.\n\n# Environments\n- Client (Optional)\n- Server (Optional)\n\n# Credits\n- StockiesLad (Owner)\n- JoostMSoftware (Co-Owner)\n- AbdElAziz333 (Forge)\n- VidTu (Ksyxis (Idea))\n- kennytv (Forcecloseloadingscreen (Code))\n\n# Features\n- 441 Pre-generator: Entirely yanks it to sync chunk generation with chunk rendering.\n- Loading Screens: Cancellable (Configurable)\n- Rendering: Pre-rendering Phase (Configurable)\n\n# Suggested With\n- C2ME: Optimises chunk generation.\n- Sodium: Optimises chunk rendering.\n\n# Explanation\nThe 441 chunk loading engine is pretty much what the name is. The reason for it being 441 chunks is that\nit generates chunks in a 10 chunk radius as a square. So multiply that by 2, add 1 (because you are standing\non a chunk) and square it. Fastload removes this *feature* as it is a huge waste of time. Instead, it will\nonly load 1 chunk (the spawn chunk) and loads the rest of the spawn region during early rendering.\n\nAlong with that, it also replaces some of the loading screens with its own implementation. This pretty much\nallows rendering to begin immediately instead of it being halted until the player spawn packet is received.\n\n# Links\n- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/fastload\n- Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastload\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/fMSnenNSXM\n\n","published":"2022-06-04T16:09:02.891982Z","updated":"2023-08-15T12:36:53.077035Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":918130,"followers":1168,"categories":["optimization","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["OAv8CrM0","hR5aj90D","Lbph3YVy","nkXCDjTX","CVP8s8T3","tFMofdbs","3j5R1tqr","opd0zx0e","iiKA1DWl","DVbkQeRT","bAEd4DsW","PjaIK1Vp","tAJHf9G7","wIStpaL0","8J8D4v6o","1wIMDix7","BnPn5A62","f4sYhmcE","meWCSzii","DJkYeZd5","1f1DA0KB","QNff3l3l","QlIwIIh9","C2LwOzJk","1uyZI4Sv","FKmzXNtY","K88McHch","DQlQxhhM","qIDVvUbg","nAfxWveV","MmygcB2M","zNe7bwry","Tv3wOvtj","ksl46t40","qkR1zzal","dKaZj3NX","bxgfNPxE","LtO049ip","RWontocM","tMBTPH4j","rGmamzE5","gdXi90uO","Dsgo7CSj","2Yda0wxa","pPHZxvSq","mBNst1pT","NHYFVTEV","WyunD6Js","N1SrNeBH","IpZXHH55","rxKwFSer","ZlGXwJvh","TQqs51tn","DadZpSjE","tMPV3Kkg","ZF0uERgW","FpDn2R2L","gIRDVsr1","a5IjqNvz","DlCLRU3a","WU1it2AO","FU50wLzH","DhZ4Ja4S","Y0vyVBp6","suyTpHDo","gO58JOqR","K9vr5fdy","OQyAqgWH","AWGFfzNY","Jy0nBwT7","n2GBDiY8","YvKzIdFE","lbg7lLOP","XzqjhWvy","GCH0zDV1","cOIVKLwU","FswsA1ru","pDTCLzgm","s3zsS0HW","tykaPrWr","ILYiaB6n","jbjSMJqM","JpRTQ4PR","vD6ndABa","WryJ0FUZ","FcFh2FAO","PB8AbQO3","BwDnLgzN","OxwM6hRt","u4FVRRGd","ys9T20o4","47qpvpOP","P17HkM27","9Kgnmrza","3cboK7gk","HDvAnQIw","Z8CqLDDO","nHeyxX0A","fbLmfqa5","ka9OYmub","5caSj7kt"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/47742fe96d19cdad9a3eb6a73bd9c7c1547fb4ad.png"},"version":{"id":"ys9T20o4","project_id":"kCpssoSb","author_id":"6RqzXTwc","featured":false,"name":"Fastload+1.18.2-1.20-3.4.0","version_number":"3.4.0","changelog":"Fixed a couple bugs, improved internal api, updated some dependencies, updated embedded fabric api to support the latest snapshot","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-05-03T07:15:33.055038Z","downloads":424375,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"024e9aa775037fe8727ac8aca55f68d2f6782dd87d099446f967ebbeb6eab73f0f0580eca100cb565f70bab02abce03239af0fca17248ceef2c05caa1cfcdd1e","sha1":"b57e4d594031638b0dc076a3b6e501f417700577"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/versions/ys9T20o4/Fastload%2B1.18.2-1.20-3.4.0.jar","filename":"Fastload+1.18.2-1.20-3.4.0.jar","primary":true,"size":567412,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"GIn4UWLW","username":"KirboSoftware","name":"Joost","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80041873?v=4","bio":"I'm a junior software engineer who creates minecraft mods in my spare time and help with projects when I can","created":"2022-06-04T15:56:54.106893Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Co-owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"6RqzXTwc","username":"StockiesLad","name":"Fluffy Bumblebee","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60066663?v=4","bio":"A lad from stockies mate.","created":"2022-06-04T16:04:13.709905Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Fastload+1.18.2-1.20-3.4.0.jar"},"mods\\dashloader-5.0.0-beta.2+1.20.0.jar":{"sha512":"103ecdb691e12cce0e59c823fbe2961cb5658f3db844b32ee4295073ee1441ca428fa795785360546d9f4ddd320e3a87ab1abf04d2a549e935b018c4e1f2eb35","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ZfQ3kTvR","slug":"dashloader","project_type":"mod","team":"Ea3e9kCo","title":"DashLoader","description":"Launch at the speed of light.","body":"<p style=\"font-family: sans-serif, tahoma, arial, helvetica; font-size: 18px; text-align: center;\" align=\"center\">\n    <!-- Features -->\n    <img src=\"https://notalpha.dev/assets/dashloader/features-new.png\" alt=\"Description\"\n         width=\"1000\"/>\n    <br/> This mod accelerates the Minecraft Asset Loading system by caching all\n    of its content, This leads to a much faster game load. It does this by caching all of its content on first launch\n    and on next launch loading back that exact cache. The cache loading is hyper fast and scalable which utilises your\n    entire system. <br/><br/><br/> <strong>Important notes:</strong> <!-- Cache slowdown explanation --> <br/><br/>\n    &bull; The first time your launch DashLoader it will be <strong>significantly slower</strong>. Because it needs to\n    create a cache which contains all the assets minecraft normally loads. This will also happen every time you change a\n    mod/resourcepack if that configuration does not have an existing cache. <!-- Mod compatibility --> <br/><br/> &bull;\n    DashLoader has been known to be incompatible with a lot of mods. DashLoader 3.0 has massively improved compatibility\n    by not forcing mod developers to add explicit support to make their assets cachable. This means that DashLoader will\n    load assets normally for mod assets that cannot be cached. While this improves mod compatibility it hurts speed as\n    the minecraft loading system is quite slow. <!-- Artists --> <br/><br/> &bull; If you use DashLoader for Developing\n    mods or creating resource packs you can press <code>f3 + t</code> to recreate the cache to load your new assets in.\n    If you want to just show off the speed of DashLoader you can press <code>shift + f3 + t</code> <br/><br/><br/>\n    <!-- Community -->\n    <img src=\"https://notalpha.dev/assets/dashloader/community-new.png\" alt=\"Community\"\n         width=\"1000\"/>\n    <br/>\n    <a href=\"https://discord.gg/VeFTrtCkrb\">\n        <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qbysL1T.png\" alt=\"Discord\" width=\"500\"/>\n    </a>\n    <!-- Sponsors -->\n    <img src=\"https://notalpha.dev/assets/dashloader/sponsors-new.png\" alt=\"Sponsors\" width=\"1000\"/>\n    <br/>\n    <a href=\"https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/\">YourKit</a>\n    Makes amazing profilers for both Java and .NET.\n    We use their Java Profiler to understand where to optimize further and make DashLoader faster. <br/>\n    <a\n            href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/\">JetBrains\n    </a>\n    Creates excellent IDEs for all programmers and have provided us\n    with access to their enterprise products for use to develop DashLoader and Hyphen.\n    <!-- Donate -->\n    <img\n            src=\"https://notalpha.dev/assets/dashloader/donate-new.png\" alt=\"Donate\" width=\"1000\"/>\n    <br/> I have a\n    <a\n            href=\"https://ko-fi.com/notequalalpha\">Ko-Fi page\n    </a>\n    if you would like to Support me. <br/> Please only support\n    me if you like what I do, and you are not in a bad financial situation to do so.\n</p>","published":"2021-04-19T09:11:56.149026Z","updated":"2023-08-14T08:07:28.472035Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":503053,"followers":1631,"categories":["library","optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17-pre5","1.17-rc1","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["BV1ALjca","qCSFZJDC","9eCZGA4u","zlSHmaBO","r4TfbmIo","uoZ9GRQf","6XZ8uzBM","8Fdayh7u","OnYC2zew","zCsGOJZc","se6qU2fa","yEJ77Dbe","KBORImrP","vAQbBj1w","HV2NHpfY","k9vsytTC","IbL8S9Tt","CsYSbmtE","Gct6yfbT","h1VgG4ob","Oub3E7JL","8vYUAyOO","fZNzww9k","EqfM9CWW","Y9ZKQAAS","QaDgUeVV","PcGOE5fz","WdNFKue4","3mMWMjAJ","FQY8wtX3","xps3tiEt","nJuq0bM2","OTK7ITDv","JQ7pEK4s","Av1aoyKG","EUniyxEp","uSvjz4bE","HX3WYeGO","bw6BzoC6","fum8FjYI","DsPMHgmj","oDlgxjWQ","bNoZcrPi","XB4YnZ4X","q9pA7KnN","zOVGzQ13","Zt4Hzppp","ctsVVcoF","mswaNhKQ","wDoBtdGY","D6bYfsNQ","VkD2LvlX","BUJc3mxs","xwPC6okA","mcU33FBx","7hqKf7qu","wgtrj8HS"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZfQ3kTvR/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"wgtrj8HS","project_id":"ZfQ3kTvR","author_id":"Y5jbSs5O","featured":false,"name":"5.0.0-beta.2 for 1.20.1","version_number":"5.0.0-beta.2+1.20.0","changelog":"# Fixes\n- Fix sodium 0.5 incompatibility\n\n# Internal Changes\n- Switch to vineflower\n- Update loom","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-14T08:07:32.489906Z","downloads":142955,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"9aab141121c1e6850621cd8144da6e6c1c2ec80c","sha512":"103ecdb691e12cce0e59c823fbe2961cb5658f3db844b32ee4295073ee1441ca428fa795785360546d9f4ddd320e3a87ab1abf04d2a549e935b018c4e1f2eb35"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZfQ3kTvR/versions/wgtrj8HS/dashloader-5.0.0-beta.2%2B1.20.0.jar","filename":"dashloader-5.0.0-beta.2+1.20.0.jar","primary":true,"size":5819388,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Ea3e9kCo","user":{"id":"Y5jbSs5O","username":"alphaqu","name":"Yan Chubikov","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24830855?v=4","bio":"java ideot","created":"2021-04-16T19:37:28.701722Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"dashloader-5.0.0-beta.2+1.20.0.jar"},"shaderpacks\\rethinking-voxels_r0.1_beta2.zip":{"sha512":"773acd817d19336c287c8a1eab6b06f42437b617b3f9ecf833f979fa5ea69cf6968454208e1b30474a2e4a591f186685ebb7c48b6b67db6c684b4193cd88ff45","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"kmwfVOoi","slug":"rethinking-voxels","project_type":"shader","team":"mJ2GH0BM","title":"Rethinking Voxels","description":"[WIP] A gameplay shaderpack based on complementary reimagined that has coloured block light with sharp shadows","body":"# Rethinking Voxels\n\nThis shader is an edit of [Complementary Reimagined](https://www.complementary.dev/reimagined) that aims to be decently fast (when compared to path tracing shaders) while having block lights cast sharp shadows.\n\n### Notes\n\nThe lighting system is not perfect.

the game boot faster by deferring non-essential initialization","body":"LazyDFU is an optimization mod for Minecraft that defers unnecessary initialization work so that it is only performed if required. Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper \"lazy\" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.\n\n**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**\n\n## Compatibility\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.\n\n**As of Minecraft 1.19.4 and above, however, Mojang has significantly optimized DFU initialization enough that this mod is no longer necessary in many configurations. It will continue to be supported for older versions of Minecraft.**\n\n## Sponsor me!\n\nDid this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## Why does it work?\n\nDataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.\n\nAs part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).\n\nAll LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.\n\n## Prove it to me\n\nI [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.\n\n## Comparing it to other mods\n\nIn comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.\n\n* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)\n* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)","published":"2021-01-04T05:14:07.259717Z","updated":"2022-06-08T01:13:18.555078Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1757956,"followers":3274,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["8tFjDrHf","aBDhdWUD","C6e265zK","4SHylIO9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hvFnDODi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4SHylIO9","project_id":"hvFnDODi","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.1.3","version_number":"0.1.3","changelog":"* Update to Minecraft 1.19\n* Mojang now (by default) does not build datafixer rules on servers.

quickly by automatically placing the correct blocks around you.\n\n![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aleksilassila/litematica-printer/printing/printer_demo.gif)\n\n## How To Use\nUsing the printer is straightforward: You can toggle the feature by pressing `CAPS_LOCK` by default. To configure variables such as\nprinting speed and range, open Litematica's settings by pressing `M + C` and navigate to \"Generic\" tab. Printer's configuration can be\nfound at the bottom of the page. You can also rebind the printing toggle under \"Hotkeys\" tab. Holding down `V` by default will also\nprint regardless if the printer is toggled on or off.\n\n### List of blacklisted blocks\nThese blocks have not been implemented yet for various reasons and the printer will skip them instead of placing them wrong. If any\nother blocks are placed incorrectly, try to lower the printing speed. If certain block is still placed incorrectly, you can create\n[an issue](https://github.com/aleksilassila/litematica-printer/issues).\n - Grindstones\n - Skulls placed on the ground\n - Signs\n - Glow lichen and vines\n - Entities, including item frames and armor stands\n\n## Requirements\nThis mod requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), [Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica), and [MaLiLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib).\n\nFabric-API is available on Modrinth however litematica and malilib are not and must be downloaded through CurseForge or their respective Githubs.\n\n## SERVER USAGE NOTE:\nPlease be aware, using this mod on a server may be against the rules and could get you banned!\n\n## GENERAL PROJECT NOTE:\nI am not a developer of this project, but I have been [given permission](https://github.com/aleksilassila/litematica-printer/issues/113#issuecomment-1212197312) to upload it here and will attempt to keep it updated.

high playercounts. \n\n**VMP is still in early development and things are expected to break. Please report any issues to our issue tracker.**\n\n## So what is VMP? \nVery Many Players, or VMP for short, is a Fabric mod designed to improve general server performance at high playercount \n**without sacrificing vanilla functionality or behavior**.  \nFor the best performance it is recommended to use VMP with [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium).\n\n## How VMP achieves its performance improvements?\n\n**Server-side game logic performance improvements:**  \n- Uses area maps to optimize nearby packet sending and player lookups\n- Uses cache to optimize entity trackers, fluid state lookups and ingredient matching\n- Optimizes entity iteration for collisions\n- Optimizes ticket propagator using MCUtil from the Paper project (patch licensed under MIT)\n\n**Client-side game logic performance improvements:**  \n- Makes time source to use built-in Java time source instead of GLFW via JNI calls\n\n**Networking performance & responsiveness improvements:**\n- Uses our own chunk sending mechanism (optionally with packet-level rate-limiting)\n- Adds packet-level per-player render distance\n- Makes vanilla tcp connections more responsive using packet priority from

Block Entities","description":"Reduce FPS lag with block entities, as well as customize them with resource packs","body":"## Enhanced Block Entities\n\nEBE is a **100% client side** Minecraft mod for the **[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/)** mod loader which aims to increase the performance of block entity rendering, as well as offer customizability via resource packs. <br/><br/>\n**How does it work?** EBE Makes some block entities use baked block models rather than laggy entity models. <br/><br/>\n**Is it just an optimization mod?** EBE isn't *just* an optimization mod, some side effects of its optimizations are many visual improvements. <br/>\nThese may include:\n- Smooth lighting on block entities\n- Being able to remodel block entities with block models\n- Toggling features like christmas chests\n- Being able to see block entities from as far away as possible\n<br/><br/>\n\n**What about animations?** The best part about EBE is that you still get to keep animations, while gaining the performance boost of baked models! Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n**Can I use it with Sodium?** Yes you can, but for this you are **required** to install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) as well. <br/><br/> \nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: Does this mod glitch the chest animation or turn chests invisible?**\n**A:** This bug has been completely eradicated in EBE versions 0.5 and above. If the issue still persists (it shouldn't), leave an issue on GitHub or join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are still invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using a Sodium version lower than 0.5, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use a Sodium version lower than 0.5 with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE). EBE also optimizes other block entities:\n- Ender Chests\n- Signs\n- Bells\n- Beds\n- Shulker Boxes\n<br/><br/>\n\n## FPS Boost\nRendering 1700 chests:\n### Vanilla\n![Before](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/before.png)\n### With EBE\n![After](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/after.png) <br/>\nA 155% frame rate increase!\n\n## Resource Packs\nHere's an example of how you can customize chests with resource packs using EBE. <br/><br/>\n![Custom Chest GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55095883/112942134-f67fe780-912f-11eb-8b11-cf316544c22b.gif)","published":"2021-03-01T00:33:17.073472Z","updated":"2023-11-26T00:58:42.011781Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1021304,"followers":2745,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["tUbREtJR","J7Zc989q","l4eXcVcY","oiMCXKDH","HHqDCd5p","bndJ1Eq5","Zl4ETunR","ILuyoK6c","qbUAJjs9","VOB3iJkd","5FTTHyNq","88qNYjJz","Id00LoSl","s76PBY7D","fZx04xgT","6NvQpIBY","fJLBqbZ5","Xdo5ZiRc","i3v1Skck","eIFo7wvq"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"i3v1Skck","project_id":"OVuFYfre","author_id":"WH9NfS5R","featured":true,"name":"EBE v0.9 for 1.20.1, 1.20","version_number":"0.9+1.20","changelog":"- Update to 1.20(.1)\n- Enhanced decorated pots","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-26T05:15:05.839603Z","downloads":475917,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"61cfe50f69f8ef9e3640c0269ef158870f5b0410","sha512":"7e8b402fd25efd396bc7f0f25a663808ae9890accc227850c454dfcdc975657f22afceb15878e781485622434a6f6d60aff2a60264aa4425edd52ebe052a0de5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/versions/i3v1Skck/enhancedblockentities-0.9%2B1.20.jar","filename":"enhancedblockentities-0.9+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":490690,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"FLGCXPFi","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"O79BATDr","user":{"id":"WH9NfS5R","username":"FoundationGames","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43485105?v=4","bio":"download my mod please","created":"2020-10-24T21:26:35.640180Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"enhancedblockentities-0.91.20.jar"},"mods\\Axiom-2.3.1-for-MC1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"93f4d61d01d6dcb7c6deb93bd5ff6f331ad57b01c9ad11b8dbcef819ad64a135ab446b349dcf9c914503147e00dacfb284ef64a2146c6738d15e8d0cfbf7e49a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"N6n5dqoA","slug":"axiom","project_type":"mod","team":"vTzVjYD6","title":"Axiom","description":"The all-in-one tool for editing Minecraft Worlds.","body":"<center><a href=\"https://axiom.moulberry.com/\"><img alt=\"Axiom Wordmark\" width=\"80%\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moulberry/AxiomBranding/main/axiom_main.svg\"></a></center>\n\n---\n\n<center>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://axiom.moulberry.com/\">\n<img alt=\"visit the website\" height=\"48\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moulberry/AxiomBranding/main/visit_website_badge.svg\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://axiomdocs.moulberry.com/\">\n<img alt=\"read the docs\" height=\"48\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/documentation/ghpages_vector.svg\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/\">\n<img alt=\"breaks with optifine\"  height=\"48\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moulberry/AxiomBranding/main/breaks_optifine.svg\"> </a> \n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/axiomtool\">\n<img alt=\"discord-plural\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/social/discord-plural_vector.svg\"></a>\n\n<img alt=\"fabric-api\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/requires/fabric-api_vector.svg\">\n\n<img alt=\"forge\" height=\"48\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/unsupported/forge_vector.svg\">\n\n</center>\n\n---\n<center>\n<h3><a href=\"https://axiom.moulberry.com/\">https://axiom.moulberry.com/</a></h3>\nBy installing Axiom, you agree to the EULA available at <a href=\"https://axiom.moulberry.com/eula\">https://axiom.moulberry.com/eula</a>\n</center>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n**Axiom** is an all-in-one tool for Minecraft editing.

The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-09-02T11:05:20.777780Z","updated":"2024-01-19T17:19:07.095202Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1509103,"followers":1895,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","23w05a","23w06a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WRaSIAfC","9TFyuVJN","DM1biniZ","iYzpWd2Z","Af0BJTus","6Fl6Ilzn","RsiSJn8g","4M515h9Z","Op8HYd0I","knEInTQd","2To1GHMW","zngBEiw5","JLCAxM5G","FKVJYGyf","hbt0DzsC","FxNs8Edj","EyhlJvkj","VdIvtIwz","mW3CVg5N","UIAaWmvd","wibQ6TRj","GkKQsCJ6","3EWbdCzX","bIVYcRpm","eQtAB8nC","TWgoDEtx","TXnYvmpI","RmZvIqeu","A04AftxZ","RLTQViRg","51iCmuDG","sj4aPwnQ","NZpUvhBc","nMuzsoQt","M5iKxVFU","VHMFG82e","6EBKvxyG","qHhZ3Mlp","CSXeGyWW","zRlTTWFK","yShEHkWR","kr3UvTk4","jZFsc9tg","oIlFdLZI","8WHpxnmg","SiEAKMh4","gfyPkvYv","Vc0cNGqC","uRw9Zalc","HOxWjhyo","9ACWUOXp","wa9YGZhd","ZqWkEgYo","zoMzOEbl","LM15Ky9N","vASIPGay","zJ1Wh6pM","DjwHtlVp","omClzsLe","zU7Ejh24","g38uL3ti","3vGF9MOJ","SqpDFYpa","M1u6F79I","3HHSMwA9","IsGTmmrV","CgwTUAR2","RPlKFmas","VPm1SrE4","RpevhOax","gJ6ZmZ4Z","Jf2pciI1","HM9McfrA","O7kIps9X","RBAUxw9P","4EU2xyVo","u6jV7Q7R","lVQpbXSe","3hsIB5yP","smEdHeFU","vede4iWJ","n8X2J9Hh","ZytICJS4","IHHNzQkV","3TfeWIWo","cwavYrLH","vMzBhYIk","StXMrAsz","5Y3n1Apc"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/1e43d5714f87ac6b20622e73b3ba7209be5ebafb.png"},"version":{"id":"3hsIB5yP","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"3.2.1+1.20 (Fabric)","version_number":"3.2.1+1.20-fabric","changelog":"# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.2.1 for 1.20.1-0\n\n## Changes\n\n### Config API\n\n- Added `ConfigClassHandler#save` and `ConfigClassHandler#load` and deprecated `ConfigClassHandler#serializer`.\n  - The serializer should now never be called directly.\n  - New load method tells serializer to load into a new instance of the config class.

It is designed to provide full Optifine parity for all resource packs that use the Optifine CTM format. Continuity also supports Optifine-format emissive textures for block and item models.\n\nContinuity depends on the Fabric API and is client-side only.

What about Resource Packs?\n  - Falling Leaves _should_ be 100% compatible with any modded trees and any resource pack changing leaves!\n\n- Does this need to be installed on the server for multiplayer?\n  - Nope! This mod is 100% client-side.\n\n- Lol fabric suxxx gief forge plx.\n  - Cheaterpaul [ported this mod to Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-forge \"Forge port\"), note that this port is inofficial and might not always be up-to-date, it also does configuration differently.\n\n- Do you have any screenshots I could look at before I install this?\n  - Sure! Check out the [images section](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-fabric/screenshots) of this mod's Curseforge page.  \n    (Note that they are slightly out of date.)\n\n- I enjoy old things. Can you backport this to Minecraft 1.7?\n  - No. We will only focus on supporting the most recently released version of Minecraft.\n\n- I found a problem / have an idea! Do I just post a comment on your CurseForge page?\n  - You **could**, but we'd prefer it if you posted an issue on [our GitHub repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/RandomMcSomethin/fallingleaves/issues).  \n    It makes it far easier for us to follow up when developing new versions of this mod.\n\n- Can I include this mod in my modpack?\n  - Absolutely! Just remember to put a link to our CurseForge page somewhere in your modpack's documentation.\n\n- What do you get if you jumble the letters in \"Falling Leaves Mod\"?\n  - You get \"Five Golden Llamas\". We're still not sure if this means anything in particular...","published":"2021-01-28T16:09:11.540414Z","updated":"2023-10-07T18:30:00.838073Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":819928,"followers":2045,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","21w41a","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["Lz5UGUqe","qBn758ZA","xQRdGvDT","QTn4WxFz","Vx5ygkPc","mqyNUioD","gqfXCbT3","oHAko2xm","RdpuJfjg","a7SgCh8W","KlJ03K3I","FaCaUOFs","jPEjJST0","dWryIdUY","uFJKVYDV","XiehU3ne","7bo5KA2S","aufE28Na","nlfT2jHV","SjhvzbUC","n7dcLucW","bSrG4Fxf","ZMbS4EYg","XYq90g2b","OSEfdzSy","HMfGMPn2","8qK6ANpJ","mva7rKdl","KpvXCE2X"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WhbRG4iK/icon.gif"},"version":{"id":"KpvXCE2X","project_id":"WhbRG4iK","author_id":"INxNlPeV","featured":false,"name":"1.15.4","version_number":"1.15.4","changelog":"add an option to turn off \"block breaking leaves\" (on-hit and on-decay) on a per-block basis","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-07T18:30:04.660427Z","downloads":367386,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"60bdf742d75a7836809087fed4e92da23dd24a09a2f222e5d2807a0fe6f1dfeff9c42c1a3cb84d20d93b3c8045b349f805d3b7b4eee4278dfe5bfe3b9bd2ebc1","sha1":"5101bd05c678a874c1fa40c3363d1c127f7074d5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WhbRG4iK/versions/KpvXCE2X/fallingleaves-1.15.4%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"fallingleaves-1.15.4+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":153985,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"sv3saz9X","user":{"id":"n4QH7y5y","username":"BrekiTomasson","name":"Breki Tomasson","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7026735?v=4","bio":"- Lead developer at TankerTrackers.com \r\n- Always juggling 20-something programming projects \r\n- <3 clean code & good code hygiene.\r\n- Java, PHP, NodeJS","created":"2021-01-28T07:40:11.099939Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"sv3saz9X","user":{"id":"INxNlPeV","username":"Fourmisain","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8464472?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-24T22:05:23.378029Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"sv3saz9X","user":{"id":"GHOKC5y2","username":"randommcsomethin","name":"Adam Malkovitch","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34224353?v=4","bio":"Chief Egg Officer of the refridgerator","created":"2021-03-22T20:48:30.163379Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fallingleaves-1.15.4+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\yosbr-0.1.2.jar":{"sha512":"254f2225f6446523aa8c8274e83b31e27f3b2afc8fe4f490fb1b169dd518e10c7993acda5db0ab597474ddf9d69506b5e794242fada1e2f89ed7bf9d412a8f78","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"WwbubTsV","slug":"yosbr","project_type":"mod","team":"GBU3scgV","title":"Your Options Shall Be Respected (YOSBR)","description":"Your options shall be respected.","body":"Your options shall be respected, brought to you by the \"Association for Options Rights\" gang.\n\nThis mod has one simple function, to provide default options if the corresponding option file doesn't exist.\n\n### Example 1 (options.txt)\n\nCreate /config/yosbr/options.txt\nPut default content in it\nLaunch game!

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-12-13T09:52:16.752416Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2333870,"followers":4345,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"unerR5MN","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Fabric/Quilt)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:39:15.937801Z","downloads":397213,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"9b7dc686bfa7937815d88c7bbc6908857cd6646b05e7a96ddbdcada328a385bd4ba056532cd1d7df9d2d7f4265fd48bd49ff683f217f6d4e817177b87f6bc457","sha1":"8fa3b84fc5860dbc30fdf8cced02af68dffcf3fa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/unerR5MN/ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":125197,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar"},"mods\\collective-1.20.1-7.30.jar":{"sha512":"8ba87686b90f6b432b314ef2ef095eaa6fd5ad5bdc81996ce379f865b1ffe41c303dd0bb66ea335177b3786033ba5b5bde17f3763db371822db98d80171dc11d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"e0M1UDsY","slug":"collective","project_type":"mod","team":"UTtoE2WS","title":"Collective","description":"🎓 Collective is a shared library with common code for all of Serilum's mods.","body":"<p><a href=\"https://serilum.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/description/header/header.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"428\" /></a><br /><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">The Fabric version requires the <a style=\"font-size: 24px;\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fabric API</a>.<br /></span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Collective is a shared library mod with common code for all of Serilum's mods.</span></strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><br /><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: #000000;\">It contains data and functions centralized in one place.

I was, too. Though there is an entity render distance setting in vanilla Minecraft, block entities are unaffected by this setting, instead using a hard-coded 64 blocks.\n\nBEER, however, overrides this. It provides a separate block entity render distance so that, for example, builds requiring banners are visible as intended from further away.\n\nFoundationGames's Enhanced Block Entities mod is highly recommended as well. Note that in most cases, EBE supercedes BEER due to it baking most (but not all) block entity models into regular blocks. I mainly made this mod for banners, as well as for compatibility with mods that add new block entities.","published":"2022-06-05T01:12:24.784806Z","updated":"2023-06-25T05:50:15.040688Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":5684,"followers":59,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["P5er2D27","nwoQymoI","KbPtRM9l","wobDc92v","5HQOBhng","V43MCrCM"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/pW8yWsAv/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"V43MCrCM","project_id":"pW8yWsAv","author_id":"3toHDfXV","featured":true,"name":"3.0.0","version_number":"3.0.0","changelog":"Added

configurable tooltip rendering, so you can *always* read them!\n\n</center></div>\n\n\n## Why was this mod created?\n\nVanilla tooltips are not very smart: this mod aims to fix that. In vanilla, there are a lot of\nsituations (especially when modded) where you just cannot read a tooltip due to it being just too long\nto fit on the screen. There are many solutions!\n\nAdaptiveTooltips aims to dream up and implement these solutions into Minecraft for a vanilla-like\ntooltip experience without the frustrations.\n\n## Features\n\nThere are many methods in which AdaptiveTooltips can save your tooltips from the clutches of the bezels;\nbelow are a list of all the (toggleable) options to fix this.\n\n### Text Wrapping\n\nThere is one very obvious fix to tooltips going off-screen horizontally: text wrapping! If a line\nis too long to fit on your screen, AdaptiveTooltips intelligently splits it into however many\nnecessary, using words as cut-offs to not interrupt your reading.\n\nThere are multiple methods of wrapping:\n- `Screen Width` - The mod wraps with a max line width of the width of your screen (minus 15). Intended to be paired\n  with **Bedrock Centering** option.\n- `Remaining Width` - Allows tooltip lines to fill a maximum of what's left until the tooltip reaches the end of the \n  screen, picking either the left or the right depending on which would require less wrapping.\n- `Half Screen Width` - Only allows tooltips to have a width of half of the screen.\n- `Smart` - Wraps lines that are considerably longer than the others, with a hard limit of 3/4 of the screen width.\n\n![Remaining Width Wrapping On/Off Comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/AdaptiveTooltips/1.19.3/screenshots/remaining-width-wrapping.png)\n*screenshot is using `Remaining Width` wrapping method*\n\n### Prioritize Tooltip Top\n\nI'm actually surprised even Mojang didn't think of adding this one, by default, tooltips that are taller than\nyour screen limit their bottom to the edge of the screen, not the top. This results in you being able to read\nthe (often less important) bottom of the tooltip instead of the top. This fix addresses that.\n\n![Prioritize Tooltip Top On/Off Comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/AdaptiveTooltips/1.19.3/screenshots/prioritize-tooltip-top.png)\n\n### Bedrock Centering\n\nThis feature grants parity between Java and Bedrock Edition. By default, Bedrock automatically centers\nthe tooltip if it is too long to fit on either the left or the right, this adds that. For the best \nexperience, it is best to pair this with **Screen Width Text Wrapping**.\n\n![Bedrock Centering On/Off Comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/AdaptiveTooltips/1.19.3/screenshots/bedrock-centering.png)\n\n### Align To Corner\n\nWhen all else fails, this feature is a good fallback. If after all the above features fail to keep the\ntooltip on the screen, AdaptiveTooltips just places the tooltip in any of the 4 corners of the window,\ndetermining that based on the least obstruction of the mouse cursor.\n\n![Align Corner Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/AdaptiveTooltips/1.19.3/screenshots/align-corner.png)\n\n### Tooltip Scrolling\n\nYes, that's right, scrolling. It's been tried on Fabric many a times with little success with annoying\nedge-cases and bugs that make using scrolling annoying, but I've fixed all grievances! You can scroll\nvertically *and* horizontally with smooth animations and fine-tuning from the scroll direction to the\nsensitivity of the scrolling. AdaptiveTooltips is also smart and knows the difference between two different\ntooltips and discards scrolling data when necessary.\n\n![Tooltip Scrolling Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/AdaptiveTooltips/1.19.3/screenshots/scrolling.gif)\n\n### Transparency Modification\n\nYou may be bothered that tooltips may obstruct the view of the next few items in your inventory, this\nfix aims to mitigate that by allowing you to adjust the transparency of the tooltip, allowing you to\ndecide what's best for in terms of visibility and transparency.\n\n![Transparency Modification Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/AdaptiveTooltips/1.19.3/screenshots/transparency-modification.png)\n\n### YACL-style GUI Tooltips\n\nCapture the style of [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yacl)'s tooltip positioning\nby placing tooltips above or below a hovered button.\n\n![YACL-style GUI Tooltips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/AdaptiveTooltips/1.19.3/screenshots/yacl-style.png)\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](/LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-11-16T18:13:05.336120Z","updated":"2023-09-28T22:50:14.493327Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":97130,"followers":319,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["IeYZcDkB","tO4SUCby","XkETuyy7","2gPUNcTb","k1kB29FF","EvE8uWRi","MgbaLEPy"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wFv8yCxM/d4a87bb29c6629923b7b29521ba67c7b6d3c6eb3.png"},"version":{"id":"MgbaLEPy","project_id":"wFv8yCxM","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"1.3.0","version_number":"1.3.0","changelog":"[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n\n- Update to 1.20.2\n- Update to YACL 3.x\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-28T22:50:15.589126Z","downloads":66972,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"4e7e930360a122eef64874a88f3410e5b050559782a8270a37e80803753af2ad1be6d9c6bd68f09ddb88e327428ff37f7e0230991fdecdd10a32b078934c7206","sha1":"2ff512a70c437c20523de01ea95b6fc9b164a5c0"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wFv8yCxM/versions/MgbaLEPy/AdaptiveTooltips-1.3.0-fabric-1.20.2.jar","filename":"AdaptiveTooltips-1.3.0-fabric-1.20.2.jar","primary":true,"size":153757,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"UZmGSXKd","user":{"id":"nyx2i4fB","username":"isxander","name":"isXander","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43245524?v=4","bio":"Kotlin & Java Developer\n\nhttps://www.isxander.dev/","created":"2021-07-23T18:53:58.220173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"AdaptiveTooltips-1.3.0-fabric-1.20.2.jar"},"mods\\indium-1.0.27+mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"c6e6627b8bb6a40497f27f86619ee5f17f68386f10585b4944e1aad01337a8f55be7401bc1824c69f94d755db3faaf16537b1d2d2cd282d24393d61df9b6fbef","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Orvt0mRa","slug":"indium","project_type":"mod","team":"X5s94xjx","title":"Indium","description":"Sodium addon providing support for the Fabric Rendering API, based on Indigo","body":"Indium is an addon for the rendering optimisation mod [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), providing support for the Fabric Rendering API. The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2023-12-19T20:08:29.445630Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2047816,"followers":5031,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9","tD2IqHXC"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Lue6O9z9","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium 1.0.27 for Minecraft 1.20.x/Sodium 0.5.3/Fabric API 0.89+","version_number":"1.0.27+mc1.20.1","changelog":"- Bump version (comp500)\n- Support new Fabric API changes and Sodium 0.5.3 (comp500)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/comp500/Indium/commits/1.0.27+mc1.20.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-23T14:02:51.056536Z","downloads":693992,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"c6e6627b8bb6a40497f27f86619ee5f17f68386f10585b4944e1aad01337a8f55be7401bc1824c69f94d755db3faaf16537b1d2d2cd282d24393d61df9b6fbef","sha1":"8c8e6b96243155b41f2f9d29d5940ee895bcb141"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/Lue6O9z9/indium-1.0.27%2Bmc1.20.1.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.27+mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":104807,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"4OZL6q9h","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X5s94xjx","user":{"id":"M6f6rkfI","username":"comp500","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1138417?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-03T01:13:52.122363Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"indium-1.0.27+mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\krypton-0.2.3.jar":{"sha512":"92b73a70737cfc1daebca211bd1525de7684b554be392714ee29cbd558f2a27a8bdda22accbe9176d6e531d74f9bf77798c28c3e8559c970f607422b6038bc9e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"fQEb0iXm","slug":"krypton","project_type":"mod","team":"LBcJZJkm","title":"Krypton","description":"A mod to optimize the Minecraft networking stack","body":"## Warning\n\n**Krypton is a work-in-progress.** I do not provide any guarantees about its stability, compatibility with other mods, or support for every possible setup out there.

These handlers have seen real-world usage and extensive profiling, and strategically deploy native code where it makes the most sense.\n* **Flush consolidation** to lower server CPU usage (and reducing the impact from hardware security vulnerabilities which exploit speculative execution) and lower server tick times.\n* **Micro-optimizations** to reduce memory usage and improve packet serialization speeds.\n\n[Please join my Discord](https://discord.gg/RUGArxEQ8J) to discuss the mod or get support.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nKrypton should work anywhere where a Minecraft can run &mdash; naturally, however, it is tuned for Linux.\n\nI try to ensure that Krypton will work with the Fabric API, Lithium, and Sodium. Support beyond these mods is provided on a best effort basis.","published":"2020-12-21T17:48:09.050177Z","updated":"2024-01-02T01:58:46.262754Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1365226,"followers":2546,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["tO4HJpLA","19624YsD","7AwqDL7J","Ff90AgU6","PGovBIXq","AXYWaIE8","kCiWZ1wv","QmrcLtH3","vJQ7plH2","UJ6FlFnK","vx0mZa04","Tncui9tU","jiDwS0W1","cQ60Ouax","X2k7QAQS","bRcuOnao"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fQEb0iXm/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"jiDwS0W1","project_id":"fQEb0iXm","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.2.3","version_number":"0.2.3","changelog":"* Updated to Minecraft 1.20\n* Removed a mixin that is now implemented in the base game\n* Improved protocol conformance - Krypton now handles servers dynamically disabling and re-enabling compression\n* Added events indicating when certain events in the network pipeline happen that mods can snoop on\n  * As a consequence of this, the old ViaFabric hooks have been removed.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-10T03:25:18.657621Z","downloads":616437,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"92b73a70737cfc1daebca211bd1525de7684b554be392714ee29cbd558f2a27a8bdda22accbe9176d6e531d74f9bf77798c28c3e8559c970f607422b6038bc9e","sha1":"4d499819effd8afe811e5d93952fcc46765a00df"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fQEb0iXm/versions/jiDwS0W1/krypton-0.2.3.jar","filename":"krypton-0.2.3.jar","primary":true,"size":185895,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"LBcJZJkm","user":{"id":"y0WF9UR5","username":"astei","name":"Andrew Steinborn","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16436212?v=4","bio":"Sometime Minecraft modder, currently an software engineer at the fintech startup Ramp","created":"2020-12-21T14:36:31.896442Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"krypton-0.2.3.jar"},"mods\\skinlayers3d-fabric-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"3c289fd8a8d90ef25692f480bf00ae2a9833ffcc7917cecdfb09dff3fcee246d1d1f7b30d94f70d26776aa9c38896ab789b8335489abb6bf0aebc4d6973764a3","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"zV5r3pPn","slug":"3dskinlayers","project_type":"mod","team":"3Lp8TMMC","title":"3D Skin Layers","description":"Render the player skin layer in 3d!","body":"![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/3d-Skin-Layers/1.19/img/MC_NU_HEADER.png)\n\n# 3d Skin Layers\n\n[![Downloads](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_521480_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/skin-layers-3d)\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/3d-Skin-Layers/1.19/img/MC_NU_BANNER1.png)\n\nReplaces the usually flat second layer of player skins with a 3d modeled version.

They occur when the server and client are out of sync; in many cases, this happens when a haste effect wears off and there's some network latency between both. The server tells the client the haste effect is gone, but the client doesn't know about this yet and sends block break events to the server at full speed. The server thinks the client is cheating so it doesn't break the blocks; the client doesn't know that so it thinks the blocks are air now. When the player tries moving into those blocks, the server kicks him back.\n\nI've seen this most often on servers that have MCMMO enabled, when super breaker runs out, but it happens when beacon effects are ending as well.\n\nGenerally, the only way to fix this is relogging, or porting away and back, to unload and re-load the chunks. This mod asks the server to resend all blocks around the player when you type /ghost, within a 4 block radius cube, thus making relogging unneccesary.

Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting.**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting system on client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will remain effective on client side only if given server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of my mod, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n \n## Installation and Use:\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric, just download the version for respective modloader. It can be installed on either client, server, or both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present at:\n\n**1. Only Client:** Client will refuse to send account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof they were actually sent from your account. Server will relay them unless `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to true in server options (which it is by default since 1.19.1), in which case you will not be able to join, unless you agree to send signed messages (the mod will supply warning screen);\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable player to system message conversion in config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signature will be stripped on client side before sending messages to server, server will make no attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough the mod can function when present on only one of the sides, it can be configured to demand itself to be installed on another side in order to play. This way you can install it on server and require all clients that join to have this mod in order to have full functionality, but can also leave it server-only if you prefer. Configuration files are located in <u>NoChatReports</u> subfolder of default config folder.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on client, this mod will disable telemetry (similarly to how [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make Velocity compatible with this mod, set `force-key-authentication = false` in `velocity.toml`. Thanks to [MrMelon54](https://github.com/MrMelon54) for pointing this out.\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to chat encryption, you can watch it to learn how to use it (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make No Chat Reports on client recognize servers with your software as safe. I wrote [a small article about this](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status). For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

This allows you to have Minecraft open on one monitor, while using other programs on another monitor - as normally Minecraft minimises when you unfocus it. This mod also adds the Borderless Windowed option to the Video Settings screen, so you can easily disable the mod ingame, and has a configuration menu accessible through Mod Menu.\n\n\nWorks on vanilla servers, and modded servers without the mod installed!\n\n\nThis mod is a rewrite of a Forge 1.12 mod, [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft), however it used to be a fork of that mod (which the 1.12 version of this mod is) - see the bottom of this page for the original description.\n\n\nSee [Borderless Window](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/borderless) by nekeras if you're looking for a similar mod for Forge 1.14+.\n\n\nOn macOS this mod is disabled by default, as it is impossible to position the window above the menu bar, and macOS has better fullscreen support anyway.\n\n\n<details><summary>Old 1.12.2 mod description</summary>\n\nThis is the latest released version (1.6.0) of the mod [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft) by hancin for MC 1.12-1.12.2, plus a fix for window resizing by me, compiled by Brycey92. This fork will be obsolete if [this PR](https://github.com/hancin/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/pull/27) is merged.\n\nThis fixes the bug where the window is not resizable after exiting fullscreen. This is a bug in LWJGL, and is fixed by [Fullscreen Fix](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-fix) and in current versions of Forge. However, the existing fixes are not applied to Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless), so this fork fixes it in that mod.\n\nSee the original Github post by Brycey92 [here](https://github.com/Brycey92/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/releases/tag/1.6.0-1).\n\nThe 1.12.2 build had the following links: [Source](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft), [Issues](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/issues)\n\n**The 1.12.2 build is licensed under the following license:**\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-2017, David Larochelle-Pratte\\\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\\\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1\\.

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2023-12-11T21:15:39.285813Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2842624,"followers":4089,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.8.8","1.8.9","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"BDwHAdWc","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.2-1.20.2 - Fabric","version_number":"1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog":"## What's Changed\r\n* Update to 1.20.2\r\n* Create fr_fr.json by @Calvineries in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* Create vi_vn.json by @ImVietnam in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Calvineries made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* @ImVietnam made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.2-1.20...1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-22T17:08:01.300588Z","downloads":680482,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"0080d3733f77e6b2e80e40d5d7bfe63dd125d94984bf92568d3434ff281f68123ec382ee53eba021278c01059299c12492dd518e61de1247f5cf7e8040bc98f1","sha1":"8e4be2bb9703deddb3d3d212c812cdc1f9de072b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/BDwHAdWc/entityculling-fabric-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-fabric-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":59348,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"Qnt13hO8","username":"tr7zw","name":"tr7zw","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Qnt13hO8/icon.png","bio":"https://tr7zw.dev/","created":"2022-05-04T13:41:52.033912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"entityculling-fabric-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\blur-3.1.0.jar":{"sha512":"c2e8d0bc87eb8bb5d36f4e980ef1a680e6238043f79553fa13248f6c9d46d18fce209ed57c66e1d1ce7aff04a397dd0ec907c3e07ff02c2c94c20998c6a22768","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"NK39zBp2","slug":"blur-fabric","project_type":"mod","team":"1VvTWfut","title":"Blur (Fabric)","description":"Adds a blur effect to all GUI backgrounds - now for Fabric (and Quilt)!","body":"<center><p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/GM4HVDC/PoBrnNM.png\" width=\"708\" height=\"204\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;Ever thought that the world behind your inventory was just too distracting?

As a result, they have closed the performance gap, obsoleting Starlight on the client side.\n\nCompatibility\n------------------\nStarlight can be installed either on the dedicated server or client. It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20.

It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n# 📈 Benchmarks\n\nThe following performance comparisons have been contributed by our community, and they show how Sodium can improve frame rates for a wide range of computers, whether fast or slow.

Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.

sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

library mod for client-side mods. Contains most of the common/shared code of masa's client mods, and adds some inter-operation support between the dependent mods.","body":"# Description\n\nMaLiLib is a library mod for client-side mods, containing most of the shared code between the dependent mods.\nFor example it contains all the configuration options and serialization, a powerful keybind system, most of the Screen/GUI code and a bunch of other miscellaneous utility classes and methods for the mods that are built around MaLiLib.\n\n(The name is short for `masa's Litemod Library` because I have zero imagination...\nThe mod was initially created for the 1.12.x LiteLoader versions of masa's client mods.)\n\n## Mods that require MaLiLib\n\nMaLiLib is required by all of [masa's](https://modrinth.com/user/masa) client-side mods, starting from the indicated versions:\n* [Item Scroller](https://modrinth.com/mod/item-scroller/) - 0.14.0 and later\n* [Litematica](https://modrinth.com/mod/litematica/) - for any builds starting from around 2018-06-11\n* [MiniHUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/minihud/) - 0.17.0 and later\n* [TellMe](https://modrinth.com/mod/tellme/) - 0.6.1 and later\n* [Tweakeroo](https://modrinth.com/mod/tweakeroo/) - 0.8.0 and later\n\nThere are also a number of other client-side mods by other authors that are built around MaLiLib. The mod project/description usually indicates which mod(s) are required as a dependency.\n\n## Mod Versions\n\n**Make sure to download the correct mod version for your Minecraft version and mod loader from the Versions page!!**\n\n**Note:** There are both Fabric and Forge versions of the mod! Look at the tagged mod loader or the file name to get the correct version of the mod for your mod loader!\n\nThe file name always indicates the mod loader (for example Fabric vs. Forge) and the Minecraft version.\nThe file name is in the format:\n`malilib-<mod loader>-<MC version>-<mod version>.jar`\n\nFor example:\n`malilib-fabric-1.19.2-0.13.0.jar`\n\nThe required version of malilib for each mod version *may be* indicated in the changelog of each of the dependent mods.  But basically you want to get the version of all the mods that were the latest released version at the given time, to avoid version mismatches.\n\nThis would mostly become more tricky to figure out if you for some reason want to use certain older mod versions than the latest available version for a given MC version. Especially the 0.9.x and 0.10.x version era of MaLiLib for MC 1.12.2 and 1.14.x and 1.15.x (and maybe also 1.16.x still?) were kinda volatile for version compatibility. Also the releases based on the code rewrites, starting from MaLiLib 0.50.0 and going until the eventual 1.0.0 release change lots of things between versions, so getting all the mods from the same release date is crucial.","published":"2022-11-13T10:42:15.245705Z","updated":"2024-01-03T22:39:19.142849Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":39225,"followers":104,"categories":["library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.13.2","19w03c","1.14","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","19w36a","19w37a","19w38b","19w39a","19w40a","19w41a","19w44a","19w46b","1.15-pre1","1.15-pre3","1.15-pre4","1.15-pre6","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","20w06a","20w09a","20w10a","20w11a","20w12a","20w13a","20w14a","20w15a","20w16a","20w17a","20w18a","20w19a","20w20b","20w21a","20w22a","1.16-pre2","1.16-pre3","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","20w45a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5","21w05a","21w08b","21w13a","21w14a","21w18a","1.17-pre4","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","23w43b","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","liteloader","rift"],"versions":["xpR792B4","JOreljE2","GqJQjBaQ","pfIN0DE8","pEa77F0R","Kp1bn8Wo","DCEIIABn","eIuMPvKJ","tK3R1pP4","lnocmCI9","246Md9Ry","fOcHRevV","vgDmDfUm","Pu8xDtD1","ihvy9Q0Z","9EvFBimR","t8w76VqA","T1D4pEXT","YMIHZNjh","Euau0Egw","aCnJJxNJ","SKRFcsuu","sJ0vpGQ4","YCivjDgJ","T88fw3Go","vVcrJUjW","DQfN3nYw","aCdCLN9a","CLKlpHV8","eJs5BPcy","KBXbvUn5","glNpS49Q","nzayf0vT","AUMrKDpf","WkYufsBv","65EmNeSo","OA4srdXJ","oLSTbZXM","s2hC3mPG","SZbR4R54","Kspglts1","8tPQJhzV","2GXVNzhO","jwGlbCV3","EWs7FsDt","dBC9mwZ1","jMXcLH4A","xoL5eTJX","jzx8nfNF","TQqYSRpR","c4s7Zbz0","xDXYECLH","VBJVQr5k","Orgcteld","fpvuC4rF","j62IqVv1","xl3PIS2V","vDRdBvPr","GNZ1QcVs","9iSCpGAD","PanSzHVC","m4tKAdNx","CnyXjyOO","RFbJZzkP","3LX4TUEJ","brInzMZZ","re5ZP4ae","X8dJ9Bm8","SK74oJ3F","sLRwmtuK","4R0Gqncy","eRgu51VW","LOw3JVMo","AzlkNP6K","UReSBF4h","c7Fc4I7I","dR5rKVuL","Est0iV5r","unSNMf00","pQ04F8DK","M7H0THrh","UCs9tZPz","Z1z9d50i","g4mrp8Tw","mEKA79TO","NFLeefSE","rJuXJGbq","K9lL5sH3","lYJ3YGWO","adfbrE2r","MZ6YndxD","Q0t4XYBi","ofNjwck3","wbnzY76g","EKNDFW3Q","f02CW9Kn","IUSVeYEl","GGSCI6GP","1YdqB4Pt","aJFx8KWb","CDu87Ijx","ujZacei2","tP8wyMQb","RXunrjdh","JirOpckS","tHyxpoOI","BU2oeYjc","irVc8BCb","u2QfMTCe","PnnSBGlW","dWbSJQho","HiREfjem","dCJFeJSY","xvOB7EFh","SdX6LDeV","g7hz9tre","1h3OFjd5","flsBPpIL","dDzb9CtH","rOAuJf39","whn2i70Z","ChcwwPSb","GiLoOI8a","QDVOYcD0","m1uCj5FB","ROauLEoP","4sESRgiU","Gis19l54","SjGToM73","y7pWcuvN","zR6Y2P53","lUVomngZ","KT0odK2H","t9ow8DR1","Caa4rpKg","5ZOdZvFB","h3zHTglb","mpWdNRn1","SEgBLVXp","CSZC7Kg8","nVIcj6u9","AXxe1CWD","RB9rCbDS","LXxCKsbO","LUDJmeQ8","EJD0sMRf","ONcFAEMd","5dBlHNPp","sEdTPERW","n3rSKTxi","SB7tiPti","8dni8zmd","zVs7aEp7","iQzeIzoA","CsKg2NQk","goJg4U99","yn5ciBxa","bie47ObU","yXQKbbFN","7U8phHVA","tmL1GaA0","f7KQvBvd","1lxRNCyB","QscKmQ2D","YVnURsNX","54cA6VvF","zKgKuVqX","N37PPlGv","2lJvqczS","cm5bRnBe","8teYoIPA","5oaVbc3m","BYZbkbtD","deIiheQG","dBwOdoCw","IQkidUS4","Ylo1pzZT","6PDV12GO","cHOCOOv8","Uxcq4Jeh","5AHE21Q9","EKza0MGW","rEDRUNoN","WuABs62s","2nS83Qf7","5SAYCyFk","IjPDJthB","xENxlGYG","pfVHXuBE","jBH9KX9D","Afp8AWEJ","isJt6rth","KfknnBMq","Lav6afIY","HljUtdhE","LhSZt6EF","C5EHWwTF","IY24B9AK","gxgIbzfz","PbcpAEvc","O2DJgzRi","o0AtO0eq","Frx9MtJc","ym1OdFaV","Bg19XPU7","QXOpZ38S","HXSuzGfa","V21ryIsV","Tcv1nnVY","ForaIThv","xVVI2sNr","AJhIEGVJ","dQTgVbDe","WHsimdn0","FYMVqf2J","o041qH7e","AxTFzVcz","M3rtbAPE","3zGlToR7","HXBBAweZ","vEQ2PjZV","HQXz1vnM","k7Vm0Wka","jYVl3riT","GnPJLycX","OEchuJwf","qOW15k2e","V7yLDtJV","wzI0QkCv","YUdoXvUT","66WY7ZfT","ZeB749FP"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GcWjdA9I/a530ae55df5e0c405f5cf1b3e4fd6163a398bdc3.png"},"version":{"id":"V7yLDtJV","project_id":"GcWjdA9I","author_id":"yduuH4WA","featured":false,"name":"0.16.3","version_number":"0.16.3","changelog":"-

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.net/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.

depth of field, lens flares and vignette\nand many, many more.\n\n## **Any Requirements?**\n* OptiFine for 1.16 or newer or Iris 1.5.0 or newer\n* A graphics card that supports OpenGL 4.3 or newer\n*

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 400 chests on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 170 FPS                 | 205 FPS              | 1.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 315 FPS                 | 410 FPS              | 1.30x       |\n\n## Compatibility\nImmediatelyFast is structured to interfere with mods as little as possible.\nIt should work fine with most if not all mods and modpacks.\n\nKnown incompatibilities:\n\n- OptiFabric / OptiFine\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/issues).\n\n## Developer API\nYou can read the latest version of the API docs [here](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/blob/1.20/API_DOCS.md).\n\n## Partners\nYourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools\nfor monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.\nYourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/),\n[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/),\nand [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/).\n\n[![YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com)\n\n---\n\nKinetic Hosting offers extremely affordable deals on servers with very good hardware!

**[ForgetMeChunk](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forgetmechunk)**\n- **[ChunkSavingFix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunk-saving-fix)**\n- **[force-close-world-loading-screen](https://modrinth.com/mod/forcecloseworldloadingscreen)**: Missing option to remove menu fully (as it isn't a bug)\n- **[No

[Discord](https://short.isxander.dev/discord)\n\n## What if I want to enable some bug fixes, but not others?\nDebugify has a configuration GUI accessible by Fabric's [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).\nIf you don't want to it, there is always the configuration file located at\n`.minecraft/config/debugify.json`\n\n![configuration menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/191992486-4ba9bd8f-db37-4021-b302-7f54701d8b08.png)\n\n## Client, or Server?\nDebugify includes many fixes for both the client and server (all server fixes also apply to client).\nSo you should definitely use it on both.\n\n## Can I include this in my modpack?\nYes! Of course! I even added a little feature in the mod for you! The constant updates may be exhausting to maintain,\nso I added a config option that defaults new bug fixes to off, until you get round to looking at it.\n\n## Credits\n-

Gap Fix","description":"Fixes gaps in Block Models and Item Models","body":"Model Gap FIX\n\n \n\nThis is a simple client mod that fixes https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-73186\n\nwhich affects both Block Models and Item Models and possibly other models too\n\n \n\nThe mod works by removing texture zooming, making every model face use 100% of its texture, unlike of what it did previoulsly.\n\nThisnot only fixes this bugs on items (where it's most noticeable) but with block models too and everything else that might use those functions.\n\n \n\nThis issue was especially noticeable with custom block models or some 2d items.\n\n \n\n \n\nQ&A:\n\n- Will this slow down my game? \n\nNot at all! Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly. Note that this last part only applies to forge as fabric does not seem to have such tiny lines and the models work right away with no extra quad\n\n ","published":"2022-09-13T21:58:16.905418Z","updated":"2023-06-24T14:46:17.540175Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":671441,"followers":937,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["aZZZrtpR","vJ00juj2","7ainrOrH","EglYgeMq","Kfbnfh5q","i0mERlxq","ZvRvG9JE","r6uVoUxU","fbaUxdx3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/5a8203e120985d11616614e11ad7b888997000d8.png"},"version":{"id":"r6uVoUxU","project_id":"QdG47OkI","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.14","version_number":"1.14","changelog":"1.20 fix. works for me","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-24T14:44:16.042293Z","downloads":463627,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"7c6a38565820d9c1941eb9d1aadaae75cb11ed8b","sha512":"892fcccb853e097c3bc11b7205ccd7e99432a6eefee0a6803432d2aa91411eaf0ade9efbd301f5b6991e9efa265cacf67f67518181c3bd2e1ab178e76a4b18c9"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/versions/r6uVoUxU/modelfix-1.14-fabric.jar","filename":"modelfix-1.14-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":65430,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nq0CQj6q","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"modelfix-1.14-fabric.jar"},"mods\\chunksfadein-v1.0.5-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"8678f5328f62732d0b28e8f66b6c9907527dfff29b49f95e4db3fbd73767b17eeba3f446b476da190c6596f619a97f14b107f3ee65219d79f21ab913afb752d8","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"JaNmzvA8","slug":"chunks-fade-in","project_type":"mod","team":"xNqnrvWG","title":"Chunks fade in","description":"A simple mod that adds fade-in animation for chunks!","body":"[Sodium]: https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium\n[Smooth Chunks]: https://modrinth.com/mod/smooth-chunks\n[ChunkAnimator]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunk-animator\n[Fabric]: https://fabricmc.net\n[Optifine]: https://www.optifine.net\n[Fade In Chunks]: https://modrinth.com/mod/fade-in-chunks\n[Iris]: https://modrinth.com/mod/iris\n[Sinytra Connector]: https://modrinth.com/mod/connector\n[Embeddium]: https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium\n\n<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api\">\n<img width=\"150\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerudion/chunksfadein/main/readme-assets/req_fabric.png\" alt=\"Requires Fabric API\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium\">\n<img width=\"150\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerudion/chunksfadein/main/readme-assets/req_sodium.png\" alt=\"Requires Sodium\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu\">\n<img width=\"150\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerudion/chunksfadein/main/readme-assets/works_modmenu.png\" alt=\"Works with Mod Menu\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/iris\">\n<img width=\"150\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerudion/chunksfadein/main/readme-assets/works_iris.png\" alt=\"Works with Iris Shaders\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric\">\n<img width=\"150\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerudion/chunksfadein/main/readme-assets/crashes_opti.png\" alt=\"Crashes with Optifabric\">\n</a>\n\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1052166699924856852?style=for-the-badge&color=informational&logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/fPbPhrQNSz)\n# Description\nThis simple mod adds fade-in animation for chunks, like in Bedrock Edition of Minecraft.
